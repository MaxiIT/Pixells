# Pixells

This is my first repository. As a newbie in programming and Git, I initiated Pixells as little project to learn about DApp development and how to use GitHub.

### Learning by doing
Additional to programming and project development, this Project should teach me how to use Git with GitHub in a proper way. Everybody is welcome to join this fun project. I think it could be very instructive to learn and build together especially for beginners. Feel free to contribute and/or contact me here on GitHub. 

### Basic Idea – First Stage 
The basic idea is to create a decentralized web application where each Pixel of a specific canvas gets ownable by Ethereum wallet address holders. In the end, it should be something like the Million Dollar Homepage in combination with Smart Contract ownership tracking. The goal is to develop a simple but smart web application which should be as decentralized as possible but without negative impact in usability. Let’s see how far we can go.

### Big Vision – Coming Stages
There are already interesting concepts and great ideas what we could do with it next. But I would rather hide them for now. 

### Why is it called Pixells?
Pixells comes from “(pictures) pics sells” in analogy to the phraseme “sex sells”. This should refer to the meaningfulness of pictures in almost all kinds of marketing and selling strategies. “Picssells” sounds like Pixels, which fits perfectly into the project's concept, as digital Pictures are all about Pixels on a screen. The focus of this project lies on the technology and not on the selling or marketing part. Because of that, the “css” is replaced” by “x”, just the remaining “l” should gently implicit to the origin of the name creation.
